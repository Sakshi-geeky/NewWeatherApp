ü§î Why I Made the Choices I Did
The app is built using modern Android development practices to ensure clean, scalable, and maintainable code:

MVVM Architecture:

For separation of concerns and cleaner code.
Makes the code more testable and easier to maintain.
Retrofit:

To fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.
Room Database:

To cache weather information locally, enabling the app to function even in offline mode.
Hilt (Dependency Injection):

To reduce boilerplate code and manage dependencies more efficiently.
Kotlin Coroutines:

To handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls and database operations without blocking the main thread.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary programming language.
Retrofit: For API integration.
Room Database: For local data storage and caching.
Hilt: For dependency injection.
Coroutines: For handling asynchronous operations.
MVVM Architecture: To keep the code modular and clean.
